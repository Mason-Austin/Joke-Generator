#Joke Generator

This repo was mainly foucsing on working with persistant data and how to use get fetch.

We made a Joke Generator that allows you to click a btn and get the setup, which the btn changes to get punchline to display the punch line. Then the btn changes to say want another.

My code also incorporates just single line and two part jokes.
